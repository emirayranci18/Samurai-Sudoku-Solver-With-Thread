# Pygame Samurai Sudoku Solver Using Thread

## How to run?

 First of all, we write the sudoku we will choose in the test.txt file as in the test.txt file. We run the program by running the Sudokugraph file. Then we enter the number 1 or 2 according to how many threads we will do in our console section. If we enter 1, it solves with 5 threads, if we enter 2, it solves with 5 threads. First comes the graph. This is the number of grid/time graph found. When we close the graph, we reach the solution of the sudoku. When we close the program after solving Sudoku, we can see which data corresponds to which grid in theveriler.txt file.
